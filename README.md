### Introduction
A semantic web application which facilitates looking up information on universities and provides guidelines for users while visiting these universities. 

It provides to select from the preferred weather statistics, information on crime rate and restaurants located near these universities

A semantic data model is developed initially to establish the relationship between the gathered datasets, ontology is created and the linked data is queried using SPARQL query language.

### How Our Application is Unique
Our application gets information on university surroundings by three search criterias namely weather, restaurants and crime rate. An interesting thing is that the application covers a wide range of user groups including researchers, scholars, university guests, exchange students, recruiters and of course students. Anyone developing a similar application in the future can reuse our data model and documentation to increase the functionality of their own application.

The web application has the following special features: 
1. Highly interactive UI for appropriate query responses.
2. SPARQL endpoint.
3. Application deployed on Amazon EC2 Instance.
